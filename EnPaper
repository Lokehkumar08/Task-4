Description:

This research presents a novel hybrid deep learning framework combining CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for early and accurate cancer diagnosis, specifically focusing on skin cancer detection. The study addresses limitations in individual CNN or ViT architectures by merging local spatial feature extraction (CNN) with global attention modeling (ViT). The system utilizes pre-trained models like ResNet50 and ViT-base/Large, enhanced by SMOTE to handle class imbalance and XAI techniques like Grad-CAM and Score-CAM for interpretability. The models were trained and tested on the ISIC skin cancer dataset, showing improved performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, making it viable for real-world medical applications. Future scope includes integrating radiomics/genomics and real-time deployment using federated learning for privacy-preserving diagnostics.
